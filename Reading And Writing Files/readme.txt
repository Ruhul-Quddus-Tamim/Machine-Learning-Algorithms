Your local university's Raptors fan club maintains a register of its active members on a .txt document. Every month they update the file by removing the members who are not active. You have been tasked with automating this with your Python skills.
Given the file currentMem, Remove each member with a 'no' in their Active column. Keep track of each of the removed members and append them to the exMem file. Make sure that the format of the original files in preserved. (Hint: Do this by reading/writing whole lines and ensuring the header remains )
Run the code block below prior to starting the exercise. The skeleton code has been provided for you. Edit only the cleanFiles function.
